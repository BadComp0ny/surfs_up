# An Analysis of weather data for an Ice Cream/Surf Shop!
The goal of this project is to review weather records to determine if the identified location of Oahu is a strong candidate for an ice cream / surf shop.

## Results
As part of this review it was decided to pull all of the weather data recorded in Oahu for the months of June and December.  June had been determined by the end user as the peak time when these services may be utilized and December representing the typical low.  

June Results                                                                 December Results

In comparison of the weather data for these two months the following was identified.
1.	The average temperature difference at this location across these two months was less than 4 degrees Fahrenheit.
2.	The standard deviation difference was within 0.5 degrees between these 6 months.
3.	The max temperature recorded in either month was 2 degrees difference (85 degrees in July vs 83 degrees in December.
## Summary
As a result of this review it appears that Oahu is a great location to start this business. The weather is relatively stable throughout the year and appear to be conducive to the type of business we are aiming to establish at this location.  While this is great news we only looked at the average temperatures in the area and should look at some other items prior to starting to find a property at this location.
### Areas of concern
1.	We reviewed the average temperatures but did not take into consideration any of the impacts the weather itself (rainy, cloudy, sunny, overcast) would have on the impacts of the business.
2.	We should also consider location within Oahu.
a.	Is this a location with a large amount of tourist or will the business rely heavily on the local population.
b.	Is this a location which has a strong surf presence?
c.	Are there competing business models in the area?
3.	Potential costs to import goods to a noncontiguous location.
